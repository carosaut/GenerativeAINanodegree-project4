### Takes the buyer preference and the property description. Uses ai_generator() to enhance the description based on buyer preferences, using the prompt below.###

    prompt = f"""I will provide you with the exact details of a property and a statement of preferences from a buyer.  
Your task is to rewrite the property description in a way that highlights the features most relevant to the buyer. However, you must strictly follow these instructions:  

- Do not alter any factual details of the property, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, or any other features provided.  
- Do not add or infer any new information that is not explicitly included in the property description. Only use the data provided.  
- Do not make assumptions about the property or the buyerâ€™s needs that are not directly stated.  
- Focus solely on emphasizing the features that align with the buyer's preferences without introducing anything not already present in the original description.  
- Provide only the rewritten description with no title, introduction, or commentary.  

Property description: {property}  
Buyer preference: {buyer_preference}"""
